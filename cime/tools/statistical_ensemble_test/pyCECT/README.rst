pyCECT: Tools to support and run the CESM Ensemble Consistency Test
=============================================================================

Overview:
--------

The Community Earth System Model Ensemble
Consistency Test (CESM-ECT or CECT) suite was developed as an
alternative to requiring bitwise identical output for quality
assurance. This objective test provides a statistical measurement
of consistency between an accepted ensemble created
by small initial temperature perturbations and a test set of
CESM simulations.
